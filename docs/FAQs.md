# FAQs

Yeah, I know there are already quite a few CAD options out there... LAD does have some reasons to exist and they are all basically answers to the FAQs (I've noticed you all can be pretty negative)

### But why Lua?

- **Lua is a great language for non-programmers**.
    - The entire language fits into a relatively small book.
    - Its designed so that you don't have to teach the user computer science to use it.
        - numbers do not need casting
        - users don't have to understand why we start counting at 0
        - users only have to learn one data structure
- **But it allows us

- **It is small no matter how you measure**
    - The entire language fits into a relatively small book. (echo?)
    - Can run in a microcontroller
    - lets c/c++ do the heavy lifting

- **Very Mature**
    - Lua is 28 years old
    - Lua is used in many AAA games

### But why not python?

### (but why male models gif) But why Lua?

### Why not Rust?
Because the real world I work in seems to not use rust very often yet and C++/Lua spark joy in me


- My favorite CAD programs are paid and their free tiers change policies often.
    - Their Version Control is built into the application reducing the compatibility with the version control systems we use.
- I have not enjoyed using freecad, tinkercad or openscad, sketchup, or blender (as cad)
